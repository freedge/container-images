# Sample application to deploy on Kubernetes

This is a simple application to test your kubernetes environment. These
instructions assume that you have some experience with Kubernetes and a lot
of experience with any container runtime (here I use Docker).

The instructions here do not list any commands as it is assumed you know
how to do it. I may add specific commands to run in the near future.

## A few items about this example:

* Assumes you alreadyy have a working Kubernetes cluster
* Assumes you already have a registry
* Does not use persistent storage

## Instructions

1. Pull latest generic redis image from Docker Hub and upload to your local registry.
2. Build custom python image in the app/ directory and upload to your local registry.
3.  

## Support

These instructions are provided as-is with no support.
